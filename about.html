		<h2>Interview Questions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>What’s your full name, and where are you from?
				<ul>
				<li>I was born as Justin D Jolley but later changed my last name to Morrow to honor my stepfather. Due to a clerical error, my middle name which was just the letter D was removed during the process</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>What are some of your hobbies or passions?
				<ul>
				<li>I'm a big Seattle Seahawks fan and excited to see them play the Texans in person in two weeks. I enjoy movies, especially action, drama, and comedy genres and spending time playing Xbox with my son. 
				I also love relaxing in the backyard or going on vacation with my family. Hawaii was a favorite until we visited Costa Rica two years ago, which took the top spot. 
				I’m passionate about technology and enjoy creating tools and resources that help people: websites, photo books, digital life celebration videos, coding apps, and more.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>What accomplishments are you most proud of?
				<ul>
				<li>I was the first in my family to graduate from college, earning an associate degree in Electronics from ITT Tech in 1999. Professionally, I’m proud of receiving multiple promotions and awards 
				throughout my career. One highlight was becoming the youngest recipient of the Peak Achievement Award at VoiceStream (now T-Mobile), followed by the Pinnacle Award which is given to the top 250 employees 
				which included a trip to Hawaii at age 21. At Verizon, I’ve received 10 "Coin of Excellence" awards and 2 "VP Coin of Excellence" awards in my 19 years with the company.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>What career or life goals are you currently working on?
				<ul>
				<li>While I hope to retire in my current role, I recognize how quickly technology and AI are evolving. That’s why I’ve returned to school to complete my bachelor’s degree and expand my programming skills. 
				My goal is to remain relevant and bring value to my organization as I look ahead to 20 more years in the workforce.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>What motivates or inspires you in your daily life?
				<ul>
				<li>My Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I strive to serve and love others well and be a light in a world that often feels divided. Though I fall short, I’m encouraged by grace and forgiveness. 
				That motivates me to show kindness, keep my word, and continue growing.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Describe a challenge you’ve overcome and what you learned from it.
				<ul>
				<li>Losing both of my parents at a young age taught me the value of life and relationships. Life is short, and the people in it matter most. Being someone, others can depend on, whether in good times or bad,
				is something I’ve learned to prioritize. Every season, even the hard ones, offers something to learn or pass along to others.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>What does success mean to you?
				<ul>
				<li>Success used to mean awards, titles, and recognition, but over time, I’ve come to see success as something deeper. It's about my relationship with my family and my faith. 
				If my wife of 22 years and my two kids feel loved and supported, and if I hear “Well done, my good and faithful servant” from my Creator one day, then I’ll know I’ve lived a successful life.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>If someone visited your site, what do you want them to take away from your story?
				<ul>
				<li>I want them to see that life is about purpose, service, and connection. You can thrive through adversity, grow through change, and live with intention. 
				I hope they feel encouraged to be authentic and pursue what matters most to them.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>What colors, styles, or designs do you feel represent you?
				<ul>
				<li>Seahawks green has always been my favorite color, with midnight blue as a close second. While I like bold colors, my preferred design style is more traditional, nothing too loud or flashy. 
				I appreciate clean, complementary designs that are timeless and effective.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Anything else unique about your journey you want to share?
				<ul>
				<li>In a time when everything is more expensive, it's tempting to chase the highest paying job, but I’ve learned that money can’t buy fulfillment. 
				I’ve left roles for more money, only to return to what I loved. When your work aligns with your passion, the reward is more than just financial, it’s peace, purpose, and joy.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
